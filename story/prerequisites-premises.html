		<h2>Prerequisites and Premises</h2>
		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
		<h4>Fred</h4>
		<p>Fred can't die. Shit broke my heart :(</p>
		<h4>Snape</h4>
		<p>Snape can't lose any of his badass-ness.</p>
		<h4>Dumbledore's Power and Fame</h4>
		<p>
			Dumbledore is the second most powerful wizard to ever live. Only reason he died of course, is, as McGonagall put it:<br>
			<em>
				"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will never have."<br>
				"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."<br>
			</em>
			One (and not because I can't think of more (I can't)) example of what Dumbledore did that glorified him:<br>
			Due to his hurt about Ariana, Dumbledore became obsessed with mind-charms, trying to alter his mind and forget about his pain, yet not forget about Ariana, something he would never achieve. Yet this specialized knowledge in mind-charms enabled him to perform one on the whole of the muggles.<br>
			During Grindelwald's ascent, the muggles found out about wizards. After Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, the wizard's decided to hide form the muggles again. Dumbledore, single-handedly, performed the most powerful mind-charm ever seen, and made all muggles forget about wizards again.
		</p>
		<h4>Wizard's Genes and Heritage</h4>
		<p>If you are a wizard, it is genetic. So there is a wizards-gene. This gene can activate, or not (This isn't in the hands of anyone, it either happens, or it doesn't). If both parents don't have this gene, their child can't be a wizard. Yet, if you have the gene, but it does not activate (so you can't use magic), you can still pass this gene on to your children, who then have a chance of activating it. This means, that muggle-borns are children to parents, where one or both have the wizards-gene, but didn't activate it. If both your parents activated the gene, your possibility to activate it aswell is very high. Vice versa, if both your parents didn't activate it, your chance to activate it is low. This is why many muggle-borns can't retrace their heritage to wizards, as for generations, their genes haven't been activated. And why most full-bloods can trace their heritage to wizards, as the possibility of activating the wizards-gene is very high.</p>
		<h3>Premises</h3>
		<h4>Harry's Protection</h4>
		<p>
			Merlin is the most powerful wizard to have ever lived. He performed a certain spell:<br>
			Merlin used all of his magical powers to protect the first child <em>A</em>, until child <em>A</em> has a child <em>B</em> of their own (their first born), with magical abilities. Then child <em>B</em> is being protected until <em>B</em> has a child <em>C</em> with magical abilities, which is then being protected, and so on. If one of the children don't have children themselves, the charm goes over to the next closest relative from the newest generation related to Merlin; basically following the line of succession without gender bias.<br>
			The charm is only as powerful as Merlin himself, so if there's ever a witch or wizard stronger than Merlin, they could kill this descendant.
		</p>
		<h4>Lily's Love</h4>
		<p>The "Lily's love"-thingy wouldn't make much sense, as most mothers would've protected their children from death, and the charm wouldn't be unique at all, hence unbalanceable. Lily is the closest descendant from Merlin in the youngest generation, which is how Harry got his protection. James stays a descendant of the Peverells. To make it obvious: Harry has both Merlin's protection, as well as the youngest Peverell brother's protection via the cloak.</p>

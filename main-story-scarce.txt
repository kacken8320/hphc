merlins casts his charm

1
-the dursleys treat harry like crap. confirmed: it is not because hes a horcrux, theyre just dicks
-hermione tells harry which potion to drink and harry collapses.
-snape lied in the riddle so that one cant know which one is the right potion, only he knows
-the potion doesnt kill so that they can interrogate the thief
-hermione promptly goes back and gets madame pomfrey, who gets snape, who makes an antidote for harry
-thus the teachers found out someones trying to steal the stone, quirrel attacks the teachers when they confront him, in the fight they kill him. voldemord escapes.

2
-the weasleys adopt harry happily after the dursleys forcible confinement of him (who wouldnt, hes the chosen one and whats one more kid). as lilys spell doesnt exist, he will never see the dursleys again.

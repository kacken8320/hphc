		<h1>Bathing Culture</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Bath houses are centres for hygiene, cleanliness, and social gatherings. They primarily serve as wellness spaces while continuing to be social meeting places, featuring baths, showers, and saunas. Bath houses are viewed as microcosms of society. They are one of many social spaces where society's values are reflected and baselined.</p>

		<h2 id="societal">Societal Perception</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Bathing is both a social ritual and a cultural expectation. Citizens are not strictly required to bathe, but it is a societal norm and habit to visit the bath houses roughly every one to two weeks. Bathing is communal: nudity is expected, but men and women are strictly separated. The visual equality created by mutual nudity reflects the established, society-wide value of equality and acts as a foundation for it. Bath houses are free spaces, yet highly regulated by societal norms. Those who break the house rules face social disapproval and may be asked to leave. By providing a shared environment, mutual respect is strengthened, social cohesion lifted and the habitual recognition of equality among all citizens is provided. Collective bathing maintains the feeling of community, as the community maintains collective bathing.</p>

		<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>
		<hr>
            <p>The infrastructure is built and maintained by the state.</p>
		    <h3 id="demographic-and-regional-distribution">Demographic and regional distribution</h3>
			<p>In general, there is roughly one bath house per 1000 citizens, ensuring convenient access for everyone. This number may be exceeded if certain citizens take longer than five minutes to reach the next bath house.</p>
			<h3 id="layout-and-architecture">Layout and Architecture</h3>
			<p>Bath houses are not built identically or in series. The foundation, walls, floors, ceilings, etc. are built with reinforced and waterproof concrete. The insides are then decorated with a combination of natural and engineered materials like wood, stone, and glass, as well as concrete, ceramic, terracotta, marble or granite, bamboo, metals, and plaster, all treated to withstand moisture. Many bath houses incorporate regional characteristics and variations, influenced by geographic location, ethnicity, traditions and culture. This can include traditional arthitecture, plants, artwork, mosaics, patterns, or motifs unique to the region. Such decorations not only reflect the heritage and identity of the local population but also create a sense of place and community within the bath house. However, each bath house contains:</p>
				<h4 id="entrance">Entrance</h4>
				<p>The entrances feature staff or machines that keep track of the daily visitors. This is due to planning bath house peak times and overall demographic statistics. Shoes are removed in the very beginning and are replaced by slippers which citizens bring themselves, as is the norm in every public facility. Modesty is preserved until the changing rooms.</p>
				<h4 id="changing-rooms">Changing rooms</h4>
				<p>Seperation of men and women start here in the changing rooms (except for the entrance and the <a href="#childrens-bath">childrens bath</a>), the genders are seperated everywhere from here on out. The changing rooms are kept open and don't feature single booths. Everyone changes together and proceeds to the storage rooms.</p>
				<h4 id="storage-rooms">Storage rooms</h4>
				<p>The rooms are to be entered fully nude. The storage rooms feature open, wooden shelves to put ones belongings. Citizens leave <em>everything</em> in the storage rooms except for a towel.</p>
				<h4 id="showers">Showers</h4>
				<p>Before entering any baths, every citizen showers thoroughly. Soap is used only for cleaning the genitals, while the rest of the body is rinsed with water alone. Soap is provided by the house. Showers are taken with hot or warm water, followed by a cold rinse, in keeping with the standard bathing practice of society. After showering, participants enter either the baths or saunas.</p>
				<h4 id="baths">Baths</h4>
				<p>There is a multitude of baths in each bath house. They feature:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lap pool - <em>for excercise, featuring long straight lines</em></li>
					<li>Hot mineral bath - <em>for relaxation, recovery and longevity</em></li>
					<li>Warm saltwater bath - <em>for relaxation, buoyancy, and skin care</em></li>
					<li>Hot jet stream bath - <em>for massage and muscle relief</em></li>
					<li>Cold bath - <em>to stimulate circulation</em></li>
					<li>Carbonated bath - <em>lightly fizzy water to improve circulation and relax muscles</em></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Every day, two of these baths are "silent" baths for relaxation, and the rest remain "societal" for socializing. As they are seperated by gender, each gender has access to one <em>silent</em> bath amd two <em>societal</em> baths. These circualte on a regular schedule.</p>
				<p>The lighting in the bath house represents the current color and brightness of the sun. During the evening and night, flickering lantern-style lights cast a warm yellow-orange glow throughout the bath house, gently signaling the transition to night and creating a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere.</p>
				<p id="childrens-bath">Most bath houses also feature a unisex childrens bath for playing. These baths feature a life guard so children can safely play while the parents relax. The childrens bath is an exception to nudity as everyone must wear proper swimwear. Parents may accompany their children here. Children may also enter baths for their gender, provided they are accompanied by their parent of the same sex.</p>
				<h4 id="saunas">Saunas</h4>
				<p>Thems is warm.</p>

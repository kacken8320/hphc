PREREQUISITS:
-snape cant loose any of his badassness

-dumbledore is the second most powerful wizard to ever live (only reason he dies of course is because he doenst touch dark magic), but this time he actually shows that, theres things he did that make everyone believe it. not stuff like twelve uses of dragons blood.
1. after the grindelwald war made the muggles turn against the wizards, they voted to make the muggles forget about them and hide. dumbledore performed the most powerful mind spell of all time and they forgot.
2. dumbledore is by far the best mind-spell wizard because he wished to one day erase his pain he felt for ariana. yet no one will ever be able to perform a mind-spell on themselves. (not even lockhard)

-not everyone with wizard blood has to be wizard or squib. they can also stay normal humans for a few generations, before the wizard genes come out again.


PREMISE:
-merlin is the most powerful wizard to have ever lived, he made a spell so that his youngest descendant cant die below the age of 20. harry is his youngest descendant. the lily "love" thingy wouldnt make much sense, as most mothers wouldve saved their child from voldemord. (lily is a descendant of merlin (she just happened to be in a family who havent been wizards for a few generations), and james stays a descendant of the peverells)

-wizards cant "join" their spells like in the hogwarts dome. that would just make everything so scale-free and utterly op. only single spells.

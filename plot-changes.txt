hermione keeps telling harry not to go to rescue sirius, even after looking for him in grimmauld place twelve; up to the point where when they want to leave, she casts a clinging curse on harry, yet the other da-members put one on her and lift harrys curse, and they are on their way to the ministry. once the curse vanished from hermione, she rushes straight to snape to tell her that the others are going to the ministry.
when luna, ginny, ron, neville and harry arrive at the ministry, the death eaters murder luna, ginny, ron and neville on the spot. they then get the prophecy from harry without killing him or damaging the prophecy, as they are adult wizards and some of the best trained killers working under voldemord, and harry just a 15 year old. they clean the dead bodies up after themselves, capture harry and alert voldemord to come.
by this time, snape has alarmed the order, and they arrive to fight. bellatrix murders sirius black. voldemord and dumbledore arrive at the same time, but voldemord shys away as he does not want the ministry to know he returned. the death eaters left no trace of a fight either, so they dont find out.
harry is traumatized beyond recovery. the weasleys will never speak to him again, as he took 2 children from them.
after spending one year (across the book) trying to convince fudge that voldemord is back, dumbledore bewitches his mind (dont know yet if imperio) and some other high ranking ministry people to make them tell everyone else that the group he bewitched noticed voldemords comeback that night. this way the whole wizarding community now believes dumbledore.
he didnt do it in the first place because he usually doesnt believe in simply bewitching someone and thinks its more powerful if they change their minds on their own.
dumbledore knows that he needs harry to defeat voldemord, so he performs a mind-spell on harry, the weasleys, hermione, lunas father and nevilles grandmother. the spell contains a part, which activates when someone speaks of this event to anyone involved. the spell puts them in a trance like state, and takes over the conversation with whomever they are talking to, indicating to them, that they do not want to speak of the events again.
everything is "back to normal", and harry and hermione are now alone.

every participant that doesnt participate, dies, thats the curse of the goblet of fire.
yet, dumbledore and the other judges (maxime and karkarov agreed, as then there was only 1 participants of hogwarts) agreed to always make harry fail in the beginning for some reason, and if he didnt stop, they would disqualify him because he didnt listen to the judges.
doing so was an easy decision for dumbledore as he doesnt need harry to participate in a deadly tournament where someones probably trying to kill him as no one knows why hes participating in the first place, he needs him to fight voldemord.
the trophy then isnt a port key as barty crouch junior told voldemord harry doesnt participate anyways, and cedric wins and lives.

hermione keeps telling harry not to go to rescue sirius, even after looking for him in grimmauld place twelve; up to the point where when they want to leave, she casts a clinging curse on harry, yet the other da-members put one on her and lift harrys curse, and they are on their way to the ministry. once the curse vanished from hermione, she rushes straight to snape to tell her that the others are going to the ministry.
when luna, ginny, ron, neville and harry arrive at the ministry, the death eaters murder luna, ginny, ron and neville on the spot. they then get the prophecy from harry without killing him or damaging the prophecy, as they are adult wizards and some of the best trained killers working under voldemord, and harry just a 15 year old. they clean the dead bodies up after themselves and alert voldemord to come.
by this time, snape has alarmed the order, and they arrive to fight. bellatrix murders sirius black. voldemord and dumbledore arrive at the same time, but voldemord shys away as he does not want the ministry to know he returned. the death eaters left no trace of a fight either, so they dont find out.
harry is traumatized beyond recovery. the weasleys will never speak to him again, as he took 2 childs from them.
dumbledore knows that he needs harry to defeat voldemord, so he performs a mind-spell und harry, the weasleys, hermione, lunas father and nevilles grandmother.
everything is "back to normal"

		<h2>Age-Power Correlation</h2>
		<p>
			The older a wizard, the more powerful they get. Power is dependent on: age, wisdom, practice, knowledge, ...<br>
			Different to muggles, wizards grow stronger in every aspect with age. (strength, height, hearing, sight, smell, reaction time, ...)<br>
			This doesn't mean they grow younger and physically stronger with time, they stay old, weak and slow, until is comes to spontaneous magical skill expression.
		</p>
		<h3>Complete Power</h3>
		<p><em>Complete Power</em> is being increased by age (<em>complete_power *= log(age)</em>). This means, the older the wizard, the more powerful all their stats get. As this increase is logarithmic, the older they get, the less powerful is the multiplier (without maths: the older they get, the slower they increase in all skills). A wizard makes more progress from age 10 to 20 than from age 250 to 260.</p>
		<h3>Height</h3>
		<p>
			Wizard's grow their whole life. They roughly follow log<sub>7</sub>(<em>x</em>), where <em>x</em> is the age. The normal fluctuations between human beings stays (so roughly +-20cm).
			<ul>
				<li>Age 10 -> ~1.2m</li>
				<li>Age 20 -> ~1.5m</li>
				<li>Age 40 -> ~1.9m</li>
				<li>Age 50 -> ~2.0m</li>
				<li>Age 75 -> ~2.2m</li>
				<li>Age 100 -> ~2.4m</li>
				<li>Age 150 -> ~2.6m</li>
				<li>Age 200 -> ~2.7m</li>
				<li>Age 250 -> ~2.8m</li>
				<li>Age 300 -> ~2.9m</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Life Expectancy</h3>
		<p>
			Probability a wizard is dead at age <em>x</em>:<br>
			(Only considering natural death)
			<ul>
				<li>Age 50 -> ~0%</li>
				<li>Age 75 -> ~1%</li>
				<li>Age 85 -> ~5%</li>
				<li>Age 100 -> ~10%</li>
				<li>Age 125 -> ~30%</li>
				<li>Age 150 -> ~60%</li>
				<li>Age 175 -> ~80%</li>
				<li>Age 200 -> ~90%</li>
				<li>Age 225 -> ~95%</li>
				<li>Age 250 -> ~99%</li>
				<li>Age 275 -> ~99.9%</li>
				<li>Age 300 -> ~99.99%</li>
			</ul>
			That means, every 100th wizard makes it to 250 years, every 1000th to 275 years, and every 10000th to 300 years.
		</p>
		<h3>Reaction Time</h3>
		<p>
			Wizards reaction times decrease with age.
			<ul>
				<li>Age 10 -> ~2sec</li>
				<li>Age 20 -> ~1.5sec</li>
				<li>Age 30 -> ~1sec</li>
				<li>Age 40 -> ~0.5sec</li>
				<li>Age 50 -> ~0.1sec</li>
				<li>Age 60 -> ~0sec</li>
				<li>Age 70 -> ~0.1sec future</li>
				<li>Age 80 -> ~0.25sec future</li>
				<li>Age 90 -> ~0.5sec future</li>
				<li>Age 100 -> ~1sec future</li>
				<li>Age 200 -> ~2sec future</li>
				<li>Age 300 -> ~3sec future</li>
			</ul>
			Don't think of these reaction times as a 300 year old grandpa catching a fly with chopsticks. Think of it as a shift in the air before a storm breaks, or an echo of something that's yet to happen. It is a deeply magical awareness, like an intuition or a sense.

three types of magic: light, dark, neutral

light and dark and purely based on emotions, the spell is only as strong as the emotion you are feeling, if you dont feel it, there is no spell, if someone has never felt it as intense as you, it will be the strongest version of this spell ever, no matter the wizards skill. all you need to cast it are the spell, the movement, and the emotion. as long as spell and movement are "recognizable", so, outsiders would get what type of spell you are trying to cast, its enough. all the energy comes purely from the emotions (light and dark).
the emotional spells compare between emotions felt in connection to other people, or not

more about dark spells:
we differentiate "bad" (harmful, aggressive, outwardly destructive) emotions and "sad" (wounded, heavy, inwardly destructive) emotions.
he who casts a "bad" spell, and kills/tortures/controls another person with that (in reference of course to avada kedavra, crucio and imperio) will from then on have a broken soul. (whats a broken soul? idk ill think of something later)
rest is fine.

neutrals are pure skill expression, craft, how well are you articulating the word (or your thoughts in non-verbals), how well are you moving your wand, your focus, your flow, practice, discipline, mastery
